"our focus in this book is on large-scale program designâ€œ

"expert programmers control the complexity of their designs with the same general
techniques used by designers of all complex systems. They combine primitive elements to
form compound objects, they abstract compound objects to form high-level building blocks,
and they preserve modularity by adopting appropriate large-scale views of system structure."

"the technology for coping with large-scale computer systems merges with the technology
for building new computer languages, and computer science itself becomes no more (and
no less) than the discipline of constructing appropriate descriptive languages."

"another advantage of Lisp is that it supports (but does not enforce) more of the large-
scale strategies for modular decomposition of programs than any other language we know."

"the entire sqrt program can be viewed as a cluster of procedures that mirrors
the decomposition of the program into subprograms."

Decomposition of trees
https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring10/scribe/lec13.pdf

"several ways to decomposing trees:
  Prefered paths: Rearrages a balanced tree to have a less balanced but nicer structure.
  Heavy-light: Decomposes any tree into paths so that every leaf-to-root path hits only log n 'heavy paths'.
  Separator decomposition: Rearranges any tree into a balanced tree by recursively splitting it into subtrees of roughly equal size.
  ART/leaf-trimming decomposition: Split the tree into 'bottom' sub-trees having <= log n leaves and a 'top' sub tree consisting of the full tree with the bottom trees removed"
