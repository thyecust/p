In mathematical logic, a variable is either a symbol representing an
un specified term of the theory (a meta-variable), or a basic object
of the theory that is manipulated without referring to its possible
intuitive interpretation.

parameter: a parametric judgment has the form “J for any a” where a is
a parameter which may occur in J.

A language of (first-order) terms is built up from variables x, y,
etc., function symbols f, g, etc., each with a unique arity, and parameters a, b, etc. in the usual way.

Terms t ::= x | a | f(t1, . . . , tn)

In order to give a self-contained explanation of negation by
an introduction rule, we employ a judgment that is parametric in
a propositional parameter p: If we can derive any p from the
hypothesis A we conclude ¬A.

We write Γ ⊢ M : A to express the judgment M is a proof term for A
under hypotheses Γ.
Note: A is a formula (statement). See A1.

Terms M ::= u               Hypotheses
  | <M1, M2>
  | fst M
  | snd M                   Conjunction
  | λu:A. M
  | M1 M2                   Implication
  | inlA M
  | inrA M                  Disjunction
  | ( case M of inl u1 ⇒ M1 | inr u2 ⇒ M2)
  | µp u:A. M
  | M1 ·A M2                Negation
  | <>                      Truth
  | abortA M                Falsehood

Definition 1.3.3. If  L is a first-order language, a formula of  L is a nonempty finite string  ϕ of symbols from  L such that either:

ϕ:≡=t1t2, where  t1 and  t2 are terms of  L, or
ϕ:≡Rt1t2…tn, where  R is an  n-ary relation symbol of  L and  t1,t2,…,tn are all terms of  L, or
ϕ:≡(¬α), where  α is a formula of  L, or
ϕ:≡(α∨β), where  α and  β are formulas of  L, or
ϕ:≡(∀v)(α), where  v is a variable and  α is a formula of  L.
