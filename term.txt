In mathematical logic, a variable is either a symbol representing an
un specified term of the theory (a meta-variable), or a basic object
of the theory that is manipulated without referring to its possible
intuitive interpretation.

parameter: a parametric judgment has the form “J for any a” where a is
a parameter which may occur in J.

A language of (first-order) terms is built up from variables x, y,
etc., function symbols f, g, etc., each with a unique arity, and parameters a, b, etc. in the usual way.

Terms t ::= x | a | f(t1, . . . , tn)

In order to give a self-contained explanation of negation by
an introduction rule, we employ a judgment that is parametric in
a propositional parameter p: If we can derive any p from the
hypothesis A we conclude ¬A.
